/**
 * Grouping of teams belonging to a particular competition. 
 * A team in the environment should always be part of one or more competitions. This is good for two reasons: Firstly, grouping of teams and second calculating
 * the relative strengths of teams within the same group. So, a team does not have an "absolute" strength but its performance is calculated based on relative
 * strength to other teams in the same group of teams, identified by participation in a specific competition. For the time being, only friendly matches are 
 * supported, however even for that, a "friendly match" competition is used.
